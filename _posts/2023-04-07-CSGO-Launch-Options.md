"3" enables adaptive Vsync with half refresh rate, which turns Vsync on and off based on the current frame rate but limits the frame rate to half of the monitor's refresh rate. "4" enables dynamic adaptive Vsync, which dynamically adjusts the frame rate to match the monitor's refresh rate and turns Vsync on and off as needed.

- <b>-noubershader:</b> Disables the use of Uber shaders, which can improve performance on some systems.
